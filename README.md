**ABSTRACT**

This project explores sexual differences in scapular morphology through linear measurements (LM) and geometric morphometric (GM) methods. Traditional LMs assess size while GM methods primarily assess shape. Our two hypotheses are 1) that the human scapula expresses sexual dimorphism in both size and shape, and; 2) because shape differences exist, the scapula will produce higher correct classification rates for sex using GM methods. Three-dimensional data were obtained from the William M. Bass Collection (n=106); linear data were obtained from the Forensic Anthropological Databank (n=1,252). 

We modeled these data separately to quantify levels of sexual dimorphism in size (LM) and shape (GM) variability. Linear measurements correctly identified 93.1% of the sample; the GM method could correctly identify 88.7% of the sample. These results indicate both size and shape drive differences between female and male shoulder girdle morphology, although the primary contributor is sexual size dimorphism (SSD). Size-free and/or allometric differences were also noted within this sample but with a much smaller impact on morphology. The human scapula produces high accuracy rates for sex estimation regardless of the utilized method.
